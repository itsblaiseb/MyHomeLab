# MyHomeLab

This is my personal **HomeLab project**, created to deepen my understanding of **networking, systems administration**, and **infrastructure automation**.

My learning journey is structured into **three phases**, designed to progressively build both technical and practical problem-solving skills.

---

## Phase 1 - AI-Assisted Learning

In this phase, I use **ChatGPT** and other AI tools to guide and assist me through the setup and configuration of my HomeLab.  
The goal is to accelerate learning, gain exposure to best practices, and build confidence in troubleshooting and documentation with AI support.

**Focus Areas:**
- Network design and configuration  
- Linux system setup and security hardening  
- Service deployment (e.g., VPN, DNS, Pi-hole, etc.)  
- Automation and scripting fundamentals  

---

## Phase 2 - Independent Rebuild & Documentation

After completing the initial setup, I will **redo the entire process independently**, using only the documentation I created during Phase 1.

**This phase emphasizes:**
- Technical writing and documentation clarity  
- Knowledge validation through self-replication  
- Including the AI questions and responses that shaped each decision  

---

## Phase 3 – From Scratch

In the final phase, I’ll rebuild the entire HomeLab **from scratch** with minimal references.  
This step tests my ability to apply learned concepts, think critically under pressure, and solve problems independently - skills crucial for **DevOps** and **system engineering** roles.

---

## Project Goals

Through this project, I aim to:
- Strengthen my skills in **Linux administration**, **networking**, and **infrastructure management**  
- Practice **automation**, **documentation**, and **continuous improvement**  
- Build a strong foundation for **self-hosted systems**, **DevOps pipelines**, and **homelab design**

## Personal Note

This HomeLab represents my commitment to **hands-on learning**, **discipline**, and **continuous growth**.  
By the end of this journey, I aim to have not only a **functional and secure home network**, but also a **detailed record of my progress** — showcasing both **technical depth** and **self-driven learning**.
